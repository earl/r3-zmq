zmqext
======

A REBOL 3 extension providing a low-level binding to the ØMQ library.


Status
------

This extension is currently developed and tested against ØMQ 2.0.10. Most parts of the ØMQ API are implemented, currently missing are:

- `zmq_setsockopt`, `zmq_getsockopt`
- `zmq_poll`

Simple REP/REQ examples already work fine. PUB/SUB is expected to work as soon
as `setsockopt` is implemented.
