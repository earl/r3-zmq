zmqext
======

A REBOL 3 extension providing a low-level binding to the ØMQ library.


Status
------

This extension is currently developed and tested against ØMQ 2.0.10. The full
API of 2.0.10 is implemented. The basic functionality is tested as working, but
the code-base is still young and no automated and extensive test-suite is in
place.

r3-zmq should already be usable for most basic scenarios. REP/REQ is
illustrated by `hwserver.r3`/`hwclient.r3` and `wuserver.r3`/`wuclient.r3` form
a basic PUB/SUB pair. `taskvent.r3`/`taskwork.r3`/`tasksink.r3` demonstrate a
two-stage PUSH/PULL chain.
